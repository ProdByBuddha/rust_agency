# 🎯 GOALS: Transitioning to Post-Labor Agency

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Sovereignty
- [ ] Migrate all critical "Think/Plan" logic to local-first `pai-core` Rust execution.
- [ ] Implement automated backups to local encrypted storage with Bitcoin-attested timestamps.
- [ ] Establish a "Rust-First" tool development pipeline, replacing legacy scripts with high-performance binaries.

## Phase 2: DSGM Value Mapping
- [ ] Analyze the current codebase to identify "extractive" patterns and refactor them into "regenerative" Rust skills.
- [ ] Establish automated metrics for "Value Created" vs. "Labor Saved" according to DSGM principles.

## Phase 3: Systemic Autonomy
- [ ] Develop autonomous "Surplus Generators"—Rust agents that identify and execute value-contributive tasks.
- [ ] Achieve complete decoupling from centralized identity and labor platforms through P2P Rust implementation.
