## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please **DO NOT** open a public issue.

Instead, please report it privately:

1.  **Email**: Send details to [Billy Coleman III](mailto:prodbybuddha@icloud.com).
2.  **GitHub Security Advisory**: If enabled, use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the Security tab.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeframe for a fix.
