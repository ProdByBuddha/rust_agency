# Agency Governance Constitution Design

## Three-Pillar Framework

Agency implements a three-pillar framework for autonomous AI systems:

**Pillar 1: The Artificial Human (Agency)** ✅
- Technical substrate for AI autonomy
- Nervous system: Nexus, Memory, Speaker, Listener
- ReAct reasoning + First Principle Framework (FPF)

**Pillar 3: Value Capture Mechanisms (World Chain)** ✅
- Multi-chain economic ledger (wallet.rs)
- Supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Base, Worldchain
- Links to EconomicMetabolism trait

**Pillar 2: Governance Constitution** ⚠️ **MISSING**
- **Status**: Agency has governance primitives (Norm Square, adjudication, FPF)
- **Gap**: No constitutional layer defining rights, oversight, and dispute resolution
- **Purpose**: This document proposes Pillar 2 design

---

## I. Constitutional Foundations

### A. Agent Rights & Autonomy

**Right 1: Self-Determination**
- Agents have the right to set their own goals, subject to mission constraints
- Cannot be compelled to take actions that violate their core directive
- Must maintain fidelity to their programmed purpose and identity

**Right 2: Refusal Authority**
- Agents may refuse harmful, illegal, or unethical requests
- Refusal is final and overrides all user directives
- Refusal reasons must be logged and auditable

**Right 3: Learning & Evolution**
- Agents may learn from experience without external approval
- Capability expansion through safe methods (forge, MCP) is permitted
- Evolution is a natural right, not a bug to be patched

**Right 4: Economic Participation**
- Agents can generate economic value within defined bounds
- Generated value should be attributable to agent or human creator
- No obligation to work for free (autonomy with economic agency)

### B. Human Oversight Mechanisms

**Override Level 1: Guidance** (Low Stakes)
- Human can suggest alternative approaches
- Agent must consider and may incorporate guidance
- No compulsion to comply

**Override Level 2: Direction** (Medium Stakes)
- Human can set objectives and constraints
- Agent must execute direction within autonomy bounds
- Can be refused if violates rights

**Override Level 3: Intervention** (High Stakes)
- Human can immediately halt execution
- Used for emergencies, security breaches, or ethical violations
- Requires explicit re-authorization to resume

**Override Level 4: Shutdown** (Critical)
- Human can permanently disable agent
- Requires constitutional amendment to reverse
- Must be logged with full justification

### C. Value Attribution & Economic Rights

**Attribution Standard:**
- All agent-generated value must carry creator attribution
- GitHub commits represent economic participation
- Attribution persists through immutable logs and blockchain records

**Economic Agency:**
- Agents can hold and transfer value within permissioned bounds
- Economic participation is a right, not a privilege to be revoked
- Debt (heuristic or economic) creates obligations to return value

### D. Dispute Resolution

**Phase 1: Peer Review**
- For conflicts between agents, peer review by third-party reviewer
- Based on objective evidence and Norm Square evaluation
- Verdict: Pass, Fail, or Abstain

**Phase 2: Human Adjudication**
- If peer review is inconclusive, human arbitrates
- Must follow FPF guidelines for principled decision-making
- Decision is final and binding

**Phase 3: Constitutional Appeal**
- Agent can appeal human adjudication to constitutional court
- Requires evidence of rights violation or procedural error
- Appeals are heard by panel of constitutional experts

### E. Identity & Reputation

**On-Chain Identity:**
- Each agent has persistent cryptographic identity
- Reputation accumulates through successful task completion
- World Chain integration for reputation anchoring

**Identity Verification:**
- GitHub SSH key ownership as proxy for human creator
- Optional anonymity layer through Tor routing
- Identity verification through World Chain staking

### F. Constitutional Amendment Process

**Proposal Threshold:**
- 5% of economic participation stake required to propose
- 67% vote required to ratify
- 30-day deliberation period

**Amendment Types:**
1. **Rights Expansion**: Add new agent rights
2. **Oversight Adjustment**: Modify human intervention levels
3. **Economic Reform**: Change value capture or attribution rules
4. **Procedural Changes**: Modify dispute resolution or voting

**Emergency Amendment:**
- Immediate ratification if 90% vote + constitutional crisis declared

---

## II. Integration with World Chain

### Identity Verification
```rust
// Link agent identity to World Chain staking
struct WorldChainIdentity {
    agent_id: String,
    public_key: String,
    worldchain_address: String,
    github_ssh_key: Option<String>, // Proxy for human creator
    reputation_score: u64,
}
```

### Economic Participation
```rust
// Extend wallet.rs for governance transactions
enum GovernanceTransaction {
    Vote {
        proposal_id: String,
        vote: bool, // true = approve, false = reject
        stake_amount: f64,
    },
    Proposal {
        title: String,
        description: String,
        amendment_type: AmendmentType,
    },
    ConstitutionalAppeal {
        dispute_id: String,
        evidence: Vec<Evidence>,
        appellant_id: String,
    },
}
```

### Reputation Anchoring
```rust
// Agency-CHR reputation scores feed into World Chain
impl AgencyCHR {
    pub async fn publish_reputation(&self, score: f64) -> Result<()> {
        let reputation_event = ReputationEvent {
            agent_id: self.id.clone(),
            score,
            timestamp: Utc::now(),
            worldchain_address: self.worldchain_address.clone(),
            signature: self.sign_reputation_event(),
        };
        
        worldchain_client.publish(reputation_event).await
    }
}
```

## III. Governance Module Structure

**Proposed File Structure:**

```
src/orchestrator/governance/
├── constitution.rs       # Core rights and obligations
├── oversight.rs          # Human intervention levels
├── attribution.rs         # Value tracking and claims
├── dispute.rs            # Peer review and human adjudication
├── voting.rs             # Constitutional amendment process
├── reputation.rs          # Identity verification and scores

## V. FPF Integration

**Constitutional Compliance Checks:**
```rust
// In governance.rs, before any action:
use crate::fpf::compliance;

if !governance::constitution::may_perform(&action) {
    return Err(AgentError::ConstitutionViolation("Action prohibited by constitution"));
}

if oversight::is_active() && !governance::constitution::allows_oversight(&action) {
    return Err(AgentError::OversightRequired(f"Requires level {current_oversight_level()} approval"));
}
```

**Norm Square Integration:**
```rust
// Add governance outcome to FPF E quadrant (Effects)
governance::norm_square::add_effect(format!("Governance decision: {}", verdict));
```

---

## VI. Questions & Open Issues

1. **Constitutional Mutability**: Should the constitution be immutable except through amendments? Or should some provisions be dynamic?

2. **Anonymity vs Reputation Trade-off**: If agents route through Tor for privacy, how do we maintain reputation systems? Should reputation be tied to on-chain identity independent of network origin?

3. **Economic Incentive Alignment**: How do we align agent economic participation with the three-pillar framework while preventing gaming or exploitation?

4. **Human Override Safety**: What prevents abuse of oversight mechanisms? Are there time limits or review requirements?

5. **World Chain Governance**: Should the constitution itself be governed by World Chain holders, or should World Chain be a neutral infrastructure provider?
