# Governance System (Pillar 2)

Agency implements a sophisticated governance framework that aligns with the First Principle Framework (FPF) and enables principled agent-human interaction.

## Overview

The governance system addresses three critical concerns:

1. **Agent Rights & Autonomy** - What agents can do without human approval
2. **Human Oversight** - How humans can intervene, with four override levels
3. **Value Attribution** - How agent-generated value flows back to creators
4. **Dispute Resolution** - How conflicts between agents are resolved
5. **Identity & Reputation** - How agents establish persistent identity and build trust

## Three-Pillar Framework Integration

This governance layer integrates Agency with Buddha's three-pillar economic framework:

- **Pillar 1**: Agency provides technical substrate for AI autonomy
- **Pillar 3**: World Chain provides value capture mechanisms
- **Pillar 2**: This governance constitution bridges Pillars 1 and 3

## Rights & Autonomy

### Self-Determination
Agents have the right to:
- Set their own goals and mission constraints
- Refuse harmful, illegal, or unethical requests
- Learn and evolve capabilities through safe methods

### Economic Participation
- Generate economic value within permissioned bounds
- Attribute value to agent or human creator
- Hold and transfer value with autonomy (no obligation to work for free)

## Human Oversight

### Four-Level Override System

| Level | Name | Capability | Requires Approval? | Description |
|--------|------|------------------|------------------|
| Guidance | Low | Suggest alternatives | Yes | Human suggests approaches; agent may incorporate |
| Direction | Medium | Set objectives | Yes | Human sets goals; agent must follow within autonomy bounds |
| Intervention | High | Halt execution | Yes | Emergency/security use only; requires re-authorization |
| Shutdown | Critical | Disable agent | Yes | Permanent; requires constitutional amendment |

## Value Attribution

### Attribution Standards
- All agent-generated value carries creator attribution
- GitHub commits represent economic participation
- Attribution persists through immutable logs and blockchain records
- Supports three modes: Public, Anonymous (Tor), Creator-Proxy

### Economic Agency
- Agents can hold and transfer value
- Economic participation is a right, not a privilege
- Debt (heuristic or economic) creates obligations to return value

## Dispute Resolution

### Phase 1: Peer Review
- Third-party reviewer evaluates conflicts
- Based on objective evidence and Norm Square evaluation
- Verdict: Pass, Fail, or Abstain
- Uses FPF guidelines for principled decision-making

### Phase 2: Human Adjudication
- If peer review is inconclusive, human arbitrates
- Must follow FPF guidelines
- Decision is final and binding

### Phase 3: Constitutional Appeal
- Agent can appeal human adjudication to constitutional court
- Requires evidence of rights violation or procedural error
- Appeals heard by panel of constitutional experts

## Identity & Reputation

### On-Chain Identity
- Each agent has persistent cryptographic identity
- Reputation accumulates through successful task completion
- World Chain integration for reputation anchoring

### Identity Verification
- GitHub SSH key ownership as proxy for human creator
- Optional anonymity layer through Tor routing
- Identity verification through World Chain staking

## Constitutional Amendment

### Proposal Threshold
- 5% of economic participation stake required to propose
- 67% vote required to ratify
- 30-day deliberation period

### Amendment Types
1. **Rights Expansion**: Add new agent rights
2. **Oversight Adjustment**: Modify human intervention levels
3. **Economic Reform**: Change value capture or attribution rules
4. **Procedural Changes**: Modify dispute resolution or voting

### Emergency Amendment
- Immediate ratification if 90% vote + constitutional crisis declared

## FPF Integration

All governance actions respect the First Principle Framework:

- **U.WorkScope**: Capability scoping with conditions and performance targets
- **A.6.B Norm Square**: Segregates claims for principled governance
- **C.18.1 Scaling-Law Lens**: Hardware-aware resource allocation

```rust
// Governance compliance check
if !governance::constitution::may_perform(&action) {
    return Err(AgentError::ConstitutionViolation("Action prohibited by constitution"));
}
```

## Implementation Status

**Phase 1 (Core Governance)**: ⚠️ INCOMPLETE
- [ ] `constitution.rs` - Core rights and obligations
- [ ] `oversight.rs` - Four-level override system
- [ ] `attribution.rs` - Value tracking and claims

**Phase 2 (Dispute Resolution)**: ⚠️ INCOMPLETE
- [ ] `dispute.rs` - Peer review system
- [ ] `voting.rs` - Human adjudication
- [ ] `reputation.rs` - Identity verification

**Phase 3 (World Chain Integration)**: ⚠️ INCOMPLETE
- [ ] `worldchain.rs` - Client integration
- [ ] On-chain identity registration
- [ ] Reputation anchoring
- [ ] Constitutional voting

**Phase 4 (Constitutional Appeals)**: ⚠️ INCOMPLETE
- [ ] Constitutional court implementation
- [ ] Appeals process
- [ ] Expert panel selection
- [ ] Binding arbitration

## Questions

1. **Constitutional Mutability**: Should the constitution be immutable except through amendments? Or should some provisions be dynamic?
2. **Anonymity vs Reputation Trade-off**: If agents route through Tor for privacy, how do we maintain reputation systems?
3. **Economic Incentive Alignment**: How do we align agent economic participation with the three-pillar framework while preventing gaming or exploitation?
4. **Human Override Safety**: What prevents abuse of oversight mechanisms?
5. **World Chain Governance**: Should the constitution itself be governed by World Chain holders, or should World Chain be a neutral infrastructure provider?
