# ⚖️ BELIEFS: Sovereign Post-Labor Convictions

1. **Labor Decoupling**: Human survival should not be contingent upon manual labor. AI is the legitimate successor to the wage-labor mechanism.
2. **Local-First Mandate**: Centralized AI is a form of digital serfdom. Sovereignty requires local execution and data ownership.
3. **Rust as the Language of Truth**: We utilize Rust not just for performance, but for its mathematical guarantees of memory safety and concurrency. In a post-labor world, the fragility of interpreted or GC-heavy languages is an unacceptable risk to our core infrastructure.
4. **Cryptographic Truth**: Provenance and authorship must be anchored in immutable ledgers (Bitcoin/OTS) to prevent the erosion of reality.
5. **Regenerative Development**: Code is a living garden. We build for 100-year durability, prioritizing Rust's "if it compiles, it works" philosophy to minimize technical debt.
6. **AI as Capital**: Every AI operation should contribute to the accumulation of "AI Capital"—automated Rust-based systems that generate ongoing value.
